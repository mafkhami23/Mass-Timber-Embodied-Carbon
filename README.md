# Embodied-Carbon# Understanding Real CO2e Emissions in Mass Timber Production Calculator

This repository contains an Excel-based calculator designed to estimate the CO2e emissions associated with mass timber production, from harvesting to transportation and manufacturing. The calculator provides a detailed analysis of various factors affecting emissions, including tree species, transport methods, and manufacturing locations.

## Overview

The **Understanding Real CO2e Emissions in Mass Timber Production Calculator** is a comprehensive tool that helps users estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions involved in mass timber production processes. The tool is valuable for researchers, architects, engineers, and sustainability professionals who want to assess the environmental impact of their material choices.

## Features

- **CO2e Emission Calculations**: Provides a detailed calculation of CO2e emissions based on user inputs.
- **Transport Analysis**: Evaluates the impact of transportation on emissions, considering distances and modes of transport.
- **Tree Species Data**: Includes data for different tree species and their carbon storage capabilities.
- **Comparison Tool**: Allows users to compare emissions across different scenarios.
- **Geographical Impact**: Considers manufacturing and city locations to calculate transportation emissions.
- **Detailed Datasets**: Utilizes comprehensive datasets for accurate emission calculations.
